# WAIT DON'T SCROLL YET!!!!!!
Hello, my name is Wissam Nusair. I understand you may want to scroll past my introduction to see my super cool projects, but I want you to truly *know* me first.

Since I was a little boy, specifically eight, I fell in love with technology. I had just learned how to inspect element on websites and viewed myself as a hacker. As silly as that may sound, my ever supportive parents bought me some books on basic coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That was my catalyst to begin my computer programming journey.

After hundreds of pages, thousands of websites, an introduction to CS course at Kent State University (I was in 4th grade when this happened), hundreds of YouTube videos, and at least 500 ChatGPT chats, I can proudly say I *love* coding.

## What I Know

Reading those paragraphs above probably make you hungry to know what *I* know. The most efficent way to explain is to show, not tell. So here is my little table with ratings on how good I am:
